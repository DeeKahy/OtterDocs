[Pterodactyl](/Hosting/Applications/Pterodactyl) is one of the best ways to host one or multiple servers because it is
easy to setup and provides a lot of functionality. That being said there is nothing wrong with just hosting it on raw
Linux if you know your way around the linux file system and can use the commandline without much issue.

## Server software

### [Purpur](https://purpurmc.org/)

[Purpur](https://purpurmc.org/) is a server software for Minecraft that is based on the Spigot server software. It adds a range of additional
features and tools to Spigot, including support for custom plugins and modpacks, as well as server management tools and
performance enhancements.

### Paper

[Purpur](https://papermc.io/) is another server software for Minecraft that is based on the Spigot server software. It is known for its focus on
performance and optimization, and it includes various enhancements and improvements that can help improve the
performance of a Minecraft server.

### Spigot / Bukkit

In almost every use case using paper or purpur is going to be better than using spigot.

### Bedrock

Bedrock is quite fast compared to its java counterparts, but it has a lot less security and has nearly zero
plugin/addon/modded support and is therefor rarely used. Bedrock integrates with mobile, console and pc as long as it
isn't java. If you want cross play you can check out [geysermc](https://geysermc.org/) with
