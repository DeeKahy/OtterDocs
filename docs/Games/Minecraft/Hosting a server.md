[Pterodactyl](/Applications/Pterodactyl) is one of the best ways to host one or multiple servers because it is 
easy to setup and provides a lot of functionality. That being said there is nothing wrong with just hosting it on raw
Linux if you know your way around the linux file system and can use the commandline without much issue.

## Server software

### Purpur

For hosting a minecraft server using [Purpur](https://purpurmc.org/) is great for the flexibility, and functionally it adds on top of Paper.

### Paper
From their website:
[Paper](https://papermc.io/) is the next generation of Minecraft servers, compatible with Spigot plugins, offering uncompromising performance.
Why use Paper? Whether you're an administrator looking to boost your server performance or a developer looking for more 
functionality.

### Bedrock

Bedrock is quite fast compared to its java counterparts, but it has a lot less security and has nearly zero 
plugin/addon/modded support and is therefor rarely used. Bedrock integrates with mobile, console and pc as long as it 
isn't java. If you want cross play you can check out [geysermc](https://geysermc.org/) with 
[floodgate](https://github.com/GeyserMC/Floodgate/).
