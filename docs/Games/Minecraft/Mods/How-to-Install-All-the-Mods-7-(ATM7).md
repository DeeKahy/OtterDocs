## [Video Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjTolqPDkgc)


## After installation

To get ATM7 to work on your server, you will need to add the following line to your server.properties file before starting the server for the first time:

```
level-type=skyblockbuilder:skyblock
```

This will ensure that the correct level type is set for the ATM7 modpack to generate the correct world.

Please note that the server.properties file is usually located in the root directory of your server files. Make sure to save the file after adding the line and then start the server.
