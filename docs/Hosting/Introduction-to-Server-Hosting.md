Server hosting is the process of hosting a server on a remote computer or network. This allows users to access and use
the server from any location with an internet connection.

Server hosting is commonly used to host websites, applications, and services, and it can be provided by a variety of
hosting providers, such as shared hosting, dedicated hosting, and cloud hosting.

When choosing a server hosting provider, it is important to consider the requirements of your server, including the type
of operating system, the amount of storage and bandwidth, and the amount of memory and processing power.

## Requirements

Different types of servers have different requirements, depending on the workload and usage of the server. Some common 
factors to consider when selecting a hosting provider include:

* Operating System: The operating system of your server should be compatible with the software and applications you 
  plan to run. Windows and Linux are the most common operating systems for servers.

* Storage and Bandwidth: The amount of storage and bandwidth you need will depend on the size and complexity of your 
  server and the amount of traffic it is expected to handle.

* Memory and Processing Power: The amount of memory and processing power you need will depend on the workload of your 
  server. Servers that are expected to handle a high workload, such as game servers, may require more memory and 
  processing power than servers that are used for simple tasks, such as hosting a website.


It is important to choose a hosting provider that can meet the requirements of your server, as insufficient resources 
can cause your server to perform poorly or even crash.
