[Lodestone](https://github.com/Lodestone-Team) is a new software written in Rust that allows users to host Minecraft servers on their own computers without the need for a dedicated server, but it can also work with a deticated server. The software is similar to Pterodactyl in its functionality, but with a focus on cross-platform compatibility. Lodestone is designed to work seamlessly on all operating systems, making it easy for users to set up and manage their Minecraft servers from a variety of devices. The software is easy to install and comes with a user-friendly interface that makes it simple to configure and manage your Minecraft servers.
