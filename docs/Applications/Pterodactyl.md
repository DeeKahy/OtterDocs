## Pterodactyl: A Linux Software for Managing Game Servers

[Pterodactyl](https://pterodactyl.io/) is a powerful Linux software that enables you to run, manage, and configure docker containers specifically for game servers. It provides a user-friendly control panel that allows you to easily deploy and manage your game servers, as well as configure settings and options to optimize their performance.

At OtterHosting, we use Pterodactyl to power our game server hosting services. It has proven to be a reliable and scalable solution for hosting a wide range of games, from popular titles like Minecraft and Ark: Survival Evolved to smaller indie games.

If you're interested in using Pterodactyl for your own game server hosting, you can find installation instructions and documentation on the [Pterodactyl website](https://pterodactyl.io/). You can also find a community of users and developers on the [Pterodactyl Discord server](https://discord.gg/pterodactyl).

!!! note

    At OtterHosting, we have made a few enhancements to Pterodactyl to make it easier to use. These include a plugin installer and a modpack installer. These modifications are not available in the standard version of Pterodactyl, but can be added if you want to do the work.



## Installation

Before you begin the installation process, you should ensure that your server meets the following requirements:

- A server running Ubuntu 18.04 or higher with a minimum of 1GB of RAM

!!! note

    you can get a server from [contabo](https://contabo.com/en/) which is our recomended budget provider.

!!! warning 

        CentOS is no longer supported by Pterodactyl anymore, but alternatives should work.
