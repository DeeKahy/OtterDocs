## Pterodactyl: A Linux Software for Managing Game Servers

[Pterodactyl](https://pterodactyl.io/) is a powerful Linux software that enables you to run, manage, and configure
docker containers specifically for game servers. It provides a user-friendly control panel that allows you to easily
deploy and manage your game servers, as well as configure settings and options to optimize their performance.

At OtterHosting, we use Pterodactyl to power our game server hosting services. It has proven to be a reliable and
scalable solution for hosting a wide range of games, from popular titles like Minecraft and Ark: Survival Evolved to
smaller indie games.

If you're interested in using Pterodactyl for your own game server hosting, you can find installation instructions and
documentation on the [Pterodactyl website](https://pterodactyl.io/). You can also find a community of users and
developers on the [Pterodactyl Discord server](https://discord.gg/pterodactyl).

!!! note

    At OtterHosting, we have made a few enhancements to Pterodactyl to make it easier to use. These include a plugin 
    installer and a modpack installer. These modifications are not available in the standard version of Pterodactyl, 
    but can be added if you want to do the work.

## Installation

Before you begin the installation process, you should ensure that you have a server running Ubuntu 18.04 or higher with
a minimum of 1GB of RAM

!!! tip

    you can get a good cheap server from [contabo](https://contabo.com/en/) which is our recomended provider when you 
    are on a budget, but you can use [vpsbenchmarks](https://www.vpsbenchmarks.com/screener) to figure out another provider 
    based on your needs.

!!! warning

    CentOS is no longer supported by Pterodactyl anymore, but alternatives like Rocky Linux and AlmaLinux should 
    work.

### post installation
After the installation you might want to add more game eggs or even discord bots like [red](Red%20Discord%20Bot.md).
You can get the eggs at [https://github.com/parkervcp/eggs](https://github.com/parkervcp/eggs) where you can download them and add them to your server.
