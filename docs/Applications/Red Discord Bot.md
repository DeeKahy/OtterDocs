Red is a fully modular bot – meaning all features and commands can be enabled/disabled to your liking, making it
completely customizable. This is a self-hosted bot – meaning you will need to host and maintain your own instance. You
can turn Red into an admin bot, music bot, trivia bot, new best friend or all of these together!

If you are interested in using Red Discord Bot, you can find installation and usage instructions on their
