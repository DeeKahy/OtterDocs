JavaScript (JS) is a programming language that is commonly used to create interactive and dynamic web applications. It
is primarily used in the front-end (client-side) of web development, but it can also be used on the back-end (
server-side) using technologies like Node.js.

JS is a versatile language that is used in a wide range of applications, from simple web forms to complex single-page
applications (SPAs). It can be used to manipulate the DOM (Document Object Model), create animations, and handle user
input and events.

One of the key strengths of JS is its ability to run natively in web browsers, which allows developers to create
interactive and dynamic web pages without the need for additional plugins or software.

## React

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is designed to make it easy to create reusable and
modular components that can be combined to build complex applications.

React uses a declarative approach to building UI, which means that developers specify how the UI should look and behave,
and React takes care of rendering the UI and handling updates. This can make it easier to develop and maintain large and
complex applications, as it allows developers to focus on the logic and functionality of their components rather than
the details of rendering and updating the UI.

React also includes a virtual DOM (Document Object Model) that allows it to efficiently update the UI without having to
redraw the entire page. This can improve the performance and responsiveness of applications, especially in cases where
the UI needs to be updated frequently.
