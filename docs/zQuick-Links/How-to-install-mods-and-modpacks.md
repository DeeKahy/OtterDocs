There are many ways to manage minecraft mods, the best ways are by using either [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/) or [PrismLauncher](https://prismlauncher.org/) which has even more functionality and is also open-source.



[PrismLauncher](https://prismlauncher.org/) has support for multiple mod sites [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/) and [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/), it also supports modpacks from [ATLauncher](https://atlauncher.com/packs/all) [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/) [feed-the-beast](https://www.feed-the-beast.com/), [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/), and [Technic Platform](https://www.technicpack.net/)
