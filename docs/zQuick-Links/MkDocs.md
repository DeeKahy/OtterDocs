[MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) is a static site generator that is designed to create documentation websites. It is
written in Python and uses
Markdown files to generate HTML pages. MkDocs is easy to use and is well-suited for creating simple and lightweight
documentation websites.

To use MkDocs, you will need to install Python and MkDocs on your computer. You can then create a new MkDocs project by
running the following command:

```bash
mkdocs new my-project
```

This will create a new directory called `my-project` with the necessary files and directories for a MkDocs project. You
can then add your documentation content to the Markdown files in the `docs` directory, and use the `mkdocs serve`
command to preview your documentation website locally.

Once you are satisfied with your documentation website, you can use the `mkdocs build` command to build the HTML files
for your website, which you can then deploy to a web host or server.
